# my website about Solar Belgrade project - database and GIS map

This website is a result of the project Solar Belgrade done within Pioneers into Practice Climate-KIC programme. 
It is a simple static website and contains link to the database and GIS map application on existing solar power plants in Belgrade in Belgrade, Serbia.

The website is available on:
<h2> https://solar-belgrade.herokuapp.com/ </h2> 

## Descritpion and application 

This is a working version of the website, database and GIS map application. Because the project realisation time was very tight I developed 
a temporary framework which I wish to upgrade in the future. 
The current solutions is based mostly on the open-source software and platforms, however, they are not enough integrated to avoid manual 
data transfer and manipulation. 

<br/>The website html is available in :open_file_folder: Heroku_website/index.html 
<br/>The project PostgreSQL database is available in :open_file_folder: PostgresPostGIS_db/DB_backups/
<br/>The project QGIS project and data is available in :open_file_folder: QGIS_project/Project/SolarBelgrade_Existing_Solar_Panels_git.qgs

## Example of code
As this is my really first website it is written with a very basic and simple html and css. 
It will be also improved and optimized with further project upgrade.
